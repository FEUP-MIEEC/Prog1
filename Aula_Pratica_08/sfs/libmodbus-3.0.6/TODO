- use TCP size in header to read full request at once

- callback mechanism

- exploit

glibc has byteswapping calls, don't invent your own:
  - le32toh(), htole32() and friends
  - bswap32() and friends()

• ntohl sur les floats (ask mailing list)
• link for get_socket
• documentation of modbus_tcp_accept, modbus_tcp_pi_listen, modbus_tcp_pi_accept
• see bug report for karlp:
has anyone used the "report slave id" function much?
with debug mode, I get: Received function not corresponding to the request (145 != 17)
but I expect to be getting ERROR Illegal function
(the device is returning 0x91 for the function code of 0x11)
it seems to be falling into the path for regular replies in check_confirmation, rather than the exception path
- to merge in v3.0.X branch
+ c7051e0d3fc8649efdb15f22e1a1707c284521a6 Fix and improve documentation of modbus_set_error_recovery
+ 9dcfed8189c473bd6308c30fdb783a2124490925 Add documentation for modbus_tcp_listen
talk about http://wz2b.users.sourceforge.net/ on SRAlab
• merge RTAI and release 3.1
